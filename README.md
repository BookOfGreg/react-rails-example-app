# React-Rails Demo Application

This repo is an example of a simple working Rails 5, Webpack(er)3, React-Rails 2.3+ application.

Where generators are used, the git commit will be the command ran to get to the current application state so it will hopefully be easy to follow along at home.

## How to test the Demo Application

#### 1) Install the JS packages:

```sh
$ yarn install # or npm install
```

#### 2) Install GEM packages:

```
$ bundle install
```

#### 3) In one terminal run the rails server:

```
$ rails s
```

#### 4) In another terminal run the webpack server:

```
$ ./bin/webpack-dev-server
```

#### 5) Visit the welcome page

```
http://localhost:3000/welcome/index
```
